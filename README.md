# README

Scribbles is a note-taking app with a fluid user interface.  It is written in ReactJS and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  Scribbles is composed of two applications: the front-end React application, which consists of assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript code, and the back-end Rails API, which renders JSON and interacts with the front-end.

See it in action <a href="https://scribbles-winnie-khuu.herokuapp.com">here</a>.
